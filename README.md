# Ze1598Bot-Tumblr-
Another Bot created with Python 3, this time for Tumblr.

This project was more a proof of concept than another project for me to update overtime. After creating Ze1598Bot for Twitter I \
wanted to experiment with other social network APIs so I tried Tumblr's.

At this time, the Bot only makes text posts for date and time and internet connection speeds. It can also create a photo post.
Anyway, as I've said this is just a proof of concept for me to know how to interact with Tumblr's API using Python in a very \
basic way. No updates are expected to be made.
